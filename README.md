# Version Control for Data Analysis

## at Sheffield City Council  

This repository contains the content and mechanisms for publishing [scc-pi.github.io/version-control](https://scc-pi.github.io/version-control/). 

The publication is a Quarto book. To learn more about Quarto books visit [quarto.org/docs/books](https://quarto.org/docs/books). However, a "book" sounds too grandiose for what is better termed as "guidance" on good practice when using version control for data analysis at Sheffield City Council. In addition to good practice, the guidance will also provide some pointers on getting started and links to other resources.        

Version control is a key principle of RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines). This repository with the published guidance, is itself an example of using version control and some other RAP tools.
