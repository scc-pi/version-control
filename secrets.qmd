# Secrets

The best way to avoid leaking secrets is to store them in local files. These can then be excluded from Git tracking with a `.gitignore` file. More likely and safer still, they will be stored within an IDEâ€˜s folder structure (e.g. `.Renviron`) so that they are available across projects and are not exposed to specific project directories and version control.
