# Introduction

A show and tell of version control for data analysis was provided for data analysts at Sheffield City Council in August 2023. A recording and the slide deck is available from the Council's Data Network Sharepoint Site.  

## Intended infrastructure

We intend for the Azure DevOps to be our default for hosting version control repositories. This will enable us to securely share code with all Council Officers. 

Making code open and transparent to everyone, not just other Council Officers, is considered best practice. Making a repository publicly available will be done by publishing it on GitHub, but only if it passes a "fit for publishing" checklist.  

Our adoption of Azure DevOps is currently on hold whilst we setup a new Data Platform. Until then, GitHub remains our current option and is subject to greater information governance considerations.
